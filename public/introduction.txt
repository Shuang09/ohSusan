A software engineer based in Montreal, passionate about the art of merging technology and creativity. I see myself not just as a coder but as a problem solver, driven by the curiosity to understand the "why" and "how" of every challenge.

Beyond the world of code, I'm an artist at heart. Drawing is my canvas, and I find joy in exploring the rich interplay of colors and textures. This artistic inclination seeps into my approach to software engineering, where I consider each project a unique masterpiece waiting to be crafted. I thrive in the synergy of logic and creativity, where coding becomes an art form. My portfolio reflects not only my technical
prowess but also my commitment to innovative solutions and a keen aesthetic sense. I am an avid reader. This love for literature enriches my perspective, infusing my work with a depth that goes beyond the surface.

Join me on this journey where technology meets art, and problems transform into opportunities. Let's create something exceptional together.
